# French-knowledge-of-US-holidays
French knowledge of American holidays: 61% average score, strong generational gaps. Data from 40 respondents.

## Abstract

This study examines French knowledge of three major American holidays 
(Halloween, Thanksgiving, Christmas) through a 20-question quiz administered 
to 40 individuals. Results show an average score of 61% (12.2/20) with 
significant generational gaps: younger respondents (12-18 years) scored 
73% while older respondents (65+) scored 52%. Women slightly outperformed 
men (62.9% vs 59%). While mainstream cultural elements were widely known 
(100% knew Halloween's date), historical aspects showed low recognition 
(10-22.5%). The findings suggest broad but superficial knowledge of 
American holidays in France, influenced by media and education rather 
than deep cultural understanding.
